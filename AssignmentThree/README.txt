Problem
-------
Add and search through reference ArrayList using hashmaps.
Be able to read and write to file. 

Guide: Write to file
-------------
Change the run configuration so there is one argument which is the file name of the file you want to write to. 
Eg: test2.txt

Guide: Read and Write to File
----------------------
Change the run configuration so there are two arguments. Firstly, the file name you want to read and then second is the filename you want to write to.
Eg: test.txt test2.txt

Known Error(s)
-----------
You cannot search for Reference in GUI. GUI does not read Search Page.
Little exception handling.


Correctness
-----------
The program will read information from file and create a book/journal based on the data.
The program will then take book/journal information and create a hashmap key.
The program will also search and return book/journal based on user search input. 
The program will then finish all book/journals to file which is specified by the program arguments.
The program will add Reference from GUI.

Improvements
------------
To make this better, I would need to be able search using the GUI.
