Test Reading from file
----------------------
The program can read any input from a file (given that is it is in proper format i.e. in the assignment pdf). This was verified by using assert to verify that all elements in ArrayList<Reference> matched what was read from file.
Program can handle any amount of information and still make a valid Reference. 

Program returns error when information is neither information related to book or journal.


Writing from file
-----------------
Program writes to whatever file is in command line.


Adding from GUI
---------------
If all text fields are filled out, the program can create a Book/Journal from it and add it to Reference ArrayList and to HashMap.
If some areas are blank, GUI will determine whether that field is important or not and either ask you to fill it out or continues if not mandatory.


Search from GUI
---------------
Search feature does not work because it does not read the textfields from the new card, only the original one. That said, HashMap works the way it should.  


Reset from GUI
--------------
Program can reset from Add menu item but not Search menu item because GUI does not read new card.


Examples
--------
If in debugger mode, run the program and go to the Add card. Fill call number, title, year, organization/publisher, and/or author(s), then press Add, the program will add that Reference to Reference array and HashMap which can be verifed in debugger mode.
